This project was basically build with an idea to improve existing ration distributing system in India.
It helps in digitalizaton of records and also makes identification of users easy with help of QR codes.

I have used Reactjs in the frontend and Nodejs with Express in backend to create this website. The data is stored in Mongodb Atlas.
The project is deployed on heroku and can be accessed through this [link](https://raquick.herokuapp.com/)
